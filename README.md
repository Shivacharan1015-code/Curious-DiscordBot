# Curious-DiscordBot
This is a very simple discord bot, I made for first time.

Make it better and host it if you want, make sure to add you're 'bot key' in the last statement and also paste your API keys which you can get for free from the respective websites.

All the libraries to be installed are 
`pip3 install discord`
`pip3 install bs4`
`pip3 install lxml`
`pip3 install json`
`pip3 install requests`
`pip3 install discord-py-slash-commad`
